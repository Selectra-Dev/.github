### Our mission: inform the consumer 🕵️‍♂️

Getting the best deal on household expenses such as energy, internet, TV and insurance isn’t always easy. Accurate and reliable information can sometimes be difficult to find, comparing offers is often time-consuming, and just getting through to someone on the phone can be a challenge.

Here at [Selectra](https://selectra.com/), we help you find the best deals on all your home utility contracts. We provide comparison and subscription services to make managing all of your utility bills simpler, cheaper, and greener!
